Project construction: SpringBoot + QQ framework

Example of use:

````java
@Service//The instance is managed by the Spring container
public class HelloWorldService {
    
    @AngelinaGroup(keyWords = {"Hello", "hello"})//When calling [Angelina Hello] or [angelina hello] in the QQ group chat, call this method
    public ReplayInfo helloWorld(MessageInfo messageInfo) {
        ReplayInfo replayInfo = new ReplayInfo();
        replayInfo.setReplayMessage("Angelina Hello World!");
        return replayInfo;//Encapsulate your return result into ReplayInfo
    }
}
````

The Angelina framework makes magic changes to SpringBoot and calls the message processing method through reflection. Developers only need to deal with business logic, and do not need to care about how to monitor/send messages. They only need to input and output according to the method regulations, plus @Angelina annotation, and the Angelina framework partially completes operations such as message reception and transmission.
